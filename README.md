# Xamarin-Maps

Repository was created to explore Xamarin Forms mobile mapping application development. I have been researching mobile development technologies and my experience with C# drove my decision to use Xamarin Forms. I am very excited to use Xamarin as part of a Geographic Information System. This particular project uses [Esri's ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/) for the mapping component.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get your copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Software you'll need to run the project

```
Visual Studio 2017
ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET
A mobile device or use Visual Studio Simulator
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```
git clone https://github.com/jasonrberney/Xamarin-Maps
cd Xamarin-Maps
Open the .sln
```

If you already have Visual Studio installed then you may need to modify your installation to include Xamarin, Android SDK's and/or Cross-Platform Mobile Development tools. If you are going with a fresh install of Visual Studio, make sure to check the Xamarin docs ([here](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/installation/windows/)) to see what you should install.
